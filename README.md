# Classes
## Theory:
Class in C++ is the building block that leads to Object-Oriented programming. 
It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.<br>
For Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brands but all of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range, etc.
So here, Car is the class, and wheels, speed limits, and mileage are their properties.<br>
An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.<br>

### Defining Class and Declaring Objects:
class ClassName<br>
{<br>
Access pacifier:<br>
Data memners;<br>
Member functions()<br>
};<br>

### Declaring Objects:
ClassName ObjectName;
