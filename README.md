# Classes
TITLE: Classes in C++ 

AIM: To write programs in C++ using classes. 

THEORY: Classes in C++ are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP).
They serve as blueprints for creating objects with attributes (data members) and behaviors (member functions or methods). 
Classes encapsulate data and methods into a single unit, promoting code reusability and modularity. 
They facilitate the modeling of real-world entities and support features like data hiding and access control through public, private, and protected access specifiers.
Inheritance allows the creation of new classes based on existing ones, while polymorphism enables different classes to be treated as instances of a common base class.
C++ classes are a key element in building structured and organized software.

ALGORITHM: 

CONCLUSION: In conclusion, classes in C++ are the cornerstone of object-oriented programming, enabling the creation of organized, reusable, and modular code. 
They encapsulate data and methods within a single unit, promoting abstraction and data hiding. Inheritance and polymorphism expand the capabilities of classes, 
facilitating code extension and flexibility. By modeling real-world entities, classes improve code maintainability and support the development of complex software systems. 
C++ classes are a powerful tool for achieving modularity and structure in software design.
